Machine Learning Test

Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict loan approval decisions based on customer data. The model uses two popular machine learning algorithms, Decision Tree and Random Forest, to classify loan applications as either approved or rejected based on various features like income, loan amount, credit score, and other customer-related details.

The dataset is divided into two parts:
Training data: Used to train the machine learning models.
Test data: Used to evaluate the performance of the models.

1. Decision Tree Classifier
The Decision Tree classifier is a simple yet effective algorithm that splits the dataset into subsets based on the feature values. The goal is to learn simple decision rules from the training data to predict the target variable. This model works well for both classification and regression problems.

2. Random Forest Classifier
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees. It works by creating multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (for classification problems) of the individual trees. Random Forest is a powerful model that can help reduce overfitting and improve accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
